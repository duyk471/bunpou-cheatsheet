# Japanese Grammar Notes

These are my personal notes from studding for grammar portion of the the JLPT test.
I don't make any claims as to their accuracy or usefulness for others.

The main goal is to be brief to allow easy review, not to be comprehensive.
For comprehensive coverage, refer to the list of references below.

The sentences that follow some grammar points are not examples from a book.
They are sentences that I wrote myself to practice using the grammar.
Since I am not a native speaker, they probably contain many errors.

The notes mostly follow the order of presentation in Shin Kanzen Master.  I use
