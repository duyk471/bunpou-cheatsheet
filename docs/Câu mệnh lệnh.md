Nên nhớ, nó khác so với [[Thể sai khiến (せる、させる)]] nha!

Về cơ bản bao gồm:て-form commands, なさい, な-commands, imperative form.

### The て-form 
If we say ちょっと待って (wait a little), this is an abbreviation of ちょっと待ってください (wait a little please), and probably because of this it's the one that's least likely to be offensive, although it's still casual.

Now, sometimes you'll hear people saying not ちょっと待って but ちょっと待ってて. What's going on here? So ちょっと待ってて is actually taking this 待っている and putting it into て-form, so that what you're being asked or instructed to do is exist in a state of waiting.

**て-form with ない helper adjective**:  `なくて`, but it also has the irregular て-form `ないで` (Có hai thể て, cái thứ hai được coi là bất quy tắc). One is when we say `do B without doing A`, so `話さないで歩く` means `walk without talking`. **The other is when we're making that て-formed command or request.**  Ví dụ như: `**泣かないで**` (don't cry), `来ないで!` (don't come).

### なさい

Now, next up in our hierarchy of commands is `なさい`. **`なさい` is attached to the い-stem of verbs**, and **when you attach `なさい` to the い-stem of a verb, you make it into a command.**
So, `起きなさい` is `get up / wake up`; `落ち着きなさい` (calm down, settle down), **we're attaching `なさい` to the い-stem of `落ち着く`,** **which means `calm down` or `settle down` and turning it into a command.**
なさい is the sort of command given by parents to children, teachers to a class, that sort of thing. It's not offensive if it's given by someone who's entitled to give it.

**な - the abbreviation of なさい**: **Something that can be confusing here is that there is an abbreviation of `なさい`** **which can be confused with a different abbreviation meaning the opposite.** **And that abbreviation is `な`.**
When we attach `な` **to the い-stem of a verb**, then we're actually abbreviating `なさい`. **So if we say `準備しな`, we're saying `準備しなさい` (get ready, get prepared)**: `準備する`, い-stem of `する`, `し` + `なさい` or `な`.

We're using な for both a command to do something and a command not to do something (Kiểu: `バカにするな` (don't make fun of me, of her) hoặc `それを食べるな` (don't eat that! [could be poison])). So how do we tell the two apart? Fortunately, it's very easy. **If the な is attached to the い-stem, then it's an abbreviation of なさい.**

### Thể mệnh lệnh え-stem
And this is formed very simply by using the bare え-stem of a godan verb or, in the case of an ichidan verb, we take off the -る as always, and replace it with -ろ. So you might hear people say in an anime 黙れ! That is the verb 黙る (to be quiet, to be silent) turned into a command: Be quiet! And this is really pretty forceful. It's stronger and potentially more offensive than うるさい! **`助けてくれ！`**

### [[のだ ・んだ]] 
**One is the `のだ / んだ` ending which is put at the end of a complete logical clause,**
As I explain in the video, it has a wide range of uses, but one of those uses is turning something into a command. So if we say 宿題をするのだ, we're saying literally It's that (you) do (your) homework.

### ように
**Also, `ように`, which as an ender would tend to be more associated with** **prayers and petitions and requests, can also form a command.**
