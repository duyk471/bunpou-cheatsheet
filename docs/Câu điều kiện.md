Trong Tiếng Nhật có không ít cách để nói về Điều kiện (Kiểu như `If` hay `When` bên Tiếng Anh).
### [[Trợ từ と]]
(we'd be dealing with a fact)
`冬になると寒くなる` – `When it becomes winter (or, if it becomes winter) it gets cold.` So why is this connected with the `exclusive and` function of と? 
-> It is connected with it because what we are saying is that only one possibility exists, only one result can follow from what we're talking about (Từ một khả năng -> Chỉ có một kết quả có thể follow theo đó).

Nói quá chẳng hạn: `それを食べると病気になる` – `If you eat that, you will get sick.`
Chỉ mang tính "hyperbole"
### ば / れば
#### Cách "chia"
Đi với động từ + thân từ え
一段：-る and add the ichidan form, -れば　（例：たべるー＞たべれば）
五段：えーstem＋ば　（例：話すー＞話せば）
Với một số động từ bất quy tắc thì: `来る` becomes `来れば` and `する` becomes `すれば`

Với tính từ thì: -い and use the helper -ければ (-い and add whatever we're going to add, the specific adjectival modifications all come from the か-き-く-け-こ row.).

#### Làm cái quái gì vậy
So this is the special characteristic of ば/れば, that it's dealing with hypotheticals (Coi nó na ná câu điều kiện loại hai trong Tiếng Anh?)
#### Mẹo vặt cuộc sống
Tip for learners: the "ba", "reba" form finally clicked for me when someone pointed out that it doesn't matter if a verb is godan or ichidan, you just remove the final "u" of the verb and replace it with "eba", even the irregular verbs Suru (Sureba) and Kuru (Kureba). So much easier to remember !!!


(Ghi chú từ mục bình luận: Chỉ thực hiện khi A đúng (?))
I think "provisional conditional" would refer to the hypothetical nature of ば・れば - the fact that it is usually referring to condition B as something provisional - i.e. only applying if A is true. This of course can be done with other conditionals too (as there is quite a bit of interchangeability) but it is the particular specialty of ば・れば

(Một số ghi chú khác)
It is 行けない but it isn't usually written with the kanji. LIterally it means "can't go" and often also used is ならない (won't become) or なれない (can't become). All these expressions are similar to English "that won't do". Not literally meaning much but used to mean "no good/not acceptable/not possible) So literally this is "Why if I don't go can't it go" = "why if I don't go won't it do" = "why is it not acceptable for me not to go" = "why do I have to go".
### たら
Cách tạo thể này: form a verb or an adjective into its -た/-だ past form (this is the only conditional that can be used about past events)
`家に帰ったらさくらがいた,` we're saying `When I returned to the house, Sakura was there`
Ở đây たら nhấn mạnh vào cái "điều gì đã xảy ra khi điều kiện được đáp ứng" còn -ば/れば, which throws more stress on the question of whether or not the condition will be fulfilled or even the fact that it wasn't fulfilled.

Most of the conditionals are interchangeable in many cases, but if we're talking about a condition which we're fully expecting to be fulfilled, we're really saying more `when` than `if`, we're most likely to use -たら.

We sometimes use the forms -ったら and -ってば with a small っ before them **to indicate exasperation**. So we might say `さくらったら` or `さくらってば`.
For example, we might say `もう言ったってば`, which is `I've already said that, haven't I?`

!!! LƯU Ý: The context in which たら is used can often imply that B follows causally from A, but たら in itself doesn't necessarily carry that implication. You will find plenty o sentences where A does not cause B and たら is used..
### なら

Put -なら after what we say and that turns it into a conditional (Không biết có phải là cái này thì hay đi với danh từ còn cái kia hay đi với động từ hay không?)
`さくらなら, できる` and that means `If it's Sakura, it will be possible`
`駅なら, あそこです` (Nhà ga thì ở kia)

(No doubt?)
