### Dấu chấm 。
So, the first mark we're going to look at is the Japanese full stop or `まる / 。`. And **this is really the exception to the rule, because it really is structurally clear.** **What it does is end a sentence.**
### Dấu phẩy 、
And that's kind of the opposite of a まる / 。, because it really is not a logical element in the sentence. It was adopted into Japanese, but unlike the English comma or other European commas, it has no logical rules. Ideas like sectioning off a subordinate clause with commas at each end, that doesn't exist in Japanese. You just put in a comma wherever you want to indicate a pause. And that's all it does.
### Dấu hỏi / ？(はてな)
Now, **in formal Japanese** we have **the question-marking particle `か`**, **which tells us that it's a question.** But **in informal Japanese we can use `か` but mostly we don't.** **Sometimes we use the question-marker `の`, but that's ambiguous because `の` can also be a statement marker.**
The only way you can really tell a question from a statement in Japanese is the rising intonation, which of course you can't hear in text. And so the question mark has become a very useful tool for indicating that rising intonation, for telling us that this is a question, not a statement.
### 「　」
**These look like little square brackets at the ends of a statement, and they work exactly the same as English quotation marks.**

Now, sometimes you'll see double quotation marks like this, 『　』 and what they do is mark a quotation that occurs inside another quotation.
### The side-marks

**What it is actually doing is either emphasizing that word or phrase or telling us that it's being used in a special sense.** So what these little marks are really doing is something like putting something into italics in English.
