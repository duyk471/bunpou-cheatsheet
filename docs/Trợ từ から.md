### Nghĩa cơ bản nhất
Nghĩa là:
`から` marks the `A` in `A from B` in such a way that it is treating `A` as the starting point or point of origin.

LÝ DO TẠI SAO LẠI CÓ NGHĨA LÀ **BỞI VÌ** TRONG MỘT SỐ CÂU: When we move to its purely metaphorical meaning, it usually means `because`. In other words, `A` is the point of origin of `B`. `寒いからコートを着る` -- `Because (it's) cold, I wear a coat` / `From the fact that (it's) cold, I'm wearing a coat.`

`たなの一つからびんを取り下した` (Có nghĩa là từ, đây là "Lấy 'cái chai' xuống từ một trong những cái giá)

`たなの一つ`: `一つ` means `one`; **`から` is a particle meaning `from`.** Now, here she's using `たな` on its own - `shelves` - and because it's not joined to anything, it's `たな` not `だな`. And so she is saying `**from** one of the shelves`- `たなの一つから`, `from one of the shelves` - notice here that `たなの一つ` is really just the same as English `**one** of the shelves` - `たなの一つ`.
