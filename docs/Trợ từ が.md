Forget what other guides tell you, the truth is that は and が both have normal and empathic usages.


Ordinary usage
が 
料理が苦手。 I’m bad at cooking.
子供たちが走った The kids ran.
鳥が空を飛んでいる。The birds are flying in the sky.
You may have heard that が always puts emphasis. While it can be, much of the time it is not. 
が here is a completely normal particle that connects the subject with the action without having any noticeable qualities.

It is possible based on context and verbal emphasis that these could be empathic が. Of these, 料理が苦手 is the most likely to be empathic が (i.e Cooking is the thing I'm bad it).

は
りんごは好きですか？ As for apples, do you like them?
あの車は高そうね。　That car, it looks pretty expensive.
料理は苦手。　I’m bad at cooking.  (As for cooking, I’m bad at it) 
The difference between this and 料理が苦手 is が is neutrally talking about oneself, where as は makes the sentence addressing 料理.
X は is a topic marker. It makes a sentence be about X: “As for X, ~”
Because は only specifies the topic, it is rather flexible in which grammar it can stand in for.

Empathic usage
が
あなたがメリーさん？ Are you (the one who’s) Mary?
A: 彼がやったの？ B: そう、彼が。　Was he the one who did it? Yes, him.
私じゃない、向こうが悪い！  It’s not mine, it’s their fault!
彼らが世界を救った。　They are the ones who saved the world.


は
は also can be used as a form of emphasis. Recall that は is used to mark something as the topic of a sentence. That is a kind of emphasis in itself (which is why we don’t keep saying 私は, as to not sound self-centered). 

Let’s take a sentence from normal が usage:
鳥が空を飛んでいる。This sentence has no particular emphasis. It’s simply noting that there are birds in the sky.
But change it to は, and the focus of the sentence is on the birds.
鳥は空を飛んでいる。As for the birds, they are flying in the sky. 

So anytime you want to address something and make the following statement be about something, you can use は. 

は’s implied contrast
は is also often used in a contrasting sense. As for X, <statement>. The clear implication is that the statement applies to X but NOT some other things.
料理は上手。　(Their cooking is good)
金はないが、ツテはある。(I have no money, but I have connections))
A:　今日は可愛いよ 。B: はああ？　(A: You look cute today. B: What did you say!??)

Generic が emphasis
You could also keep it with が and just emphasize the が with a pause. This isn’t anything grammatical. Note that this can be generic emphasis and not the が emphasis that says this in particular “the birds (as opposed to other animals) are flying in the sky”.
鳥が、空を飛んでいる。 (The birds, they’re flying in the sky)
