###  Thay thế が trong modifying clauses
> Sensei, I don't understand the use of の in 「そんなにお金のいるわけがない」Isn't お金 a noun already which is modified by そんなに? So why is the の needed?


In modifying clauses が is sometimes replaced by の so 犬が食べた辞書 can be said as 犬の食べた辞書. That is what is happening here お金がいるわけ (the first part is modifying the noun わけ just as the other phrase was modifying the noun 辞書) becomes お金のいるわけ.

Often this happens for stylistic reasons, for example when, as in this case, two がs would be repeated very close to each other without の-ing the one in the modifying clause.

朝のパリに響くのは鐘だよ.

So what's the は-marked topic? The は-marked topic is 朝のパリに響くの. So の is bundling the rest of it, in morning-Paris-resoundsの, in other words that which resounds in morning Paris. And then of course we must have a logical が-marked subject which has been defined for us by that の. So, that which resounds in morning Paris, it is (or they are) bells, よ.
