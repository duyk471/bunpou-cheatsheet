朝のパリに響くのは鐘だよ.

So what's the は-marked topic? The は-marked topic is 朝のパリに響くの. So の is bundling the rest of it, in morning-Paris-resoundsの, in other words that which resounds in morning Paris. And then of course we must have a logical が-marked subject which has been defined for us by that の. So, that which resounds in morning Paris, it is (or they are) bells, よ.
