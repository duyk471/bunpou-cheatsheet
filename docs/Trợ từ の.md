###  Thay thế が trong modifying clauses
> Sensei, I don't understand the use of の in 「そんなにお金のいるわけがない」Isn't お金 a noun already which is modified by そんなに? So why is the の needed?

In modifying clauses が is sometimes replaced by の so 犬が食べた辞書 can be said as 犬の食べた辞書. That is what is happening here お金がいるわけ (the first part is modifying the noun わけ just as the other phrase was modifying the noun 辞書) becomes お金のいるわけ.

Often this happens for stylistic reasons, for example when, as in this case, two がs would be repeated very close to each other without の-ing the one in the modifying clause.
### kbt
朝のパリに響くのは鐘だよ.

So what's the は-marked topic? The は-marked topic is 朝のパリに響くの. So の is bundling the rest of it, in morning-Paris-resoundsの, in other words that which resounds in morning Paris. And then of course we must have a logical が-marked subject which has been defined for us by that の. So, that which resounds in morning Paris, it is (or they are) bells, よ.

### Kinda like the above explain
普段から飄々として、決して本心を見せる事のないラプラス
So is the の basically setting 本心を見せる事 (Showing true feelings) as the subject? (本心を見せる never happens)

when it's in relative clauses you can almost always swap が and の without changing the meaning or nuance, but using の is often preferred since it "sounds" better (at least imo and I've heard the same from Japanese people too) since it flows into the "relative clause" vibe that attaches/describes the following noun.

You cannot however replace が with の in relative clauses that use other "weaker" binding particles like を (so 私がラーメンを食べたレストラン for example cannot be 私のラーメンを食べたレストラン but 私が食べたレストラン can be 私の食べたレストラン)

the が itself in relative clauses has no emphasizing nuance, it's just が instead of は because は does not often appear (as topic/subject at least) in relative clauses
