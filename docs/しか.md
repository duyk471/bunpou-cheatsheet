### Bản thân cái しか
`さくら**しか**いない。` (Nghĩa Tiếng Nhật là: それ以外はすべて否定する意を表す。)

しか: **While が, you might say, selects an object, a noun,** **and marks it as the A-car, the subject of the sentence,** **`しか` selects that noun, inverts the selection** **and marks that as the A-car of the sentence.**

In natural English we'd translate this as, `There's nobody here but Sakura.` **So everything other than that selected noun** **is now the A-car of the sentence.** So, `さくら**しか**いない` literally means `**Everyone other than** Sakura is not here`.

**So `しか` inverts the selection, but it's also** **what you might call a `smart invert`: it selects for relevance.**

### しか in sentences with が-marked subject 
In `タオルが**一枚**しかありません`, **the subject is `towels`**, **then we have the counter `一枚` and that is marked by `しか`.** **So we're selecting one flat thing, one towel,** **and then inverting the selection to all towels.**
So we're saying `towels, **everything but one**, non-exists`. In natural English, `There's **only one** towel`.
### しかない (Colloquial)
Now, in an ordinary `しか` sentence obviously we just say `この古い車**しかない**`, which means in natural English `There's only this old car.` **We're selecting the car, inverting the selection:** `**all cars other than** this old car **non-exist**`.
