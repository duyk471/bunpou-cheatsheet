### **What is まい？**
まい is a negative helper like ず and ぬ. 

The first unusual thing about it is that unlike most helpers, **it doesn't attach to one of the verb stems.** **It gets stuck straight onto the end of the verb in most cases.** So if we want to put it onto `行く` we just say `行くまい`. Còn ichidan thì kiểu: `見る` can become `見まい / みまい`, **but just as often it's** `見るまい`. **With the two irregulars**, `来る` and `する`, **they can be** `来るまい` and `するまい`, **but they can also be** `こまい` and `しまい`.

Không sử dụng được まい trong các trường hợp sử dụng thể ý chí khẳng định (**It doesn't do all the things that a positive volitional does**). Ví dụ như: **You can't use it as a call to action:** `行きましょう` (let's go). _(this example is positive volitional)_. **You can't say `行くまい` (let's not go) -- it doesn't mean that.** So **you can't use `まい` in let's-try-not-to-do-type constructions.**

Một số cách dùng:
- Using まい to say that **something is unlikely**. `そんなことはあるまい` (that's just not likely / I don't think such a thing is probable at all) hoặc `この降りでは彼はこまい` (In this downpour, I doubt if he'll come).
- **It represents really our subjectivity about the likelihood of something.** They're pointed at the thing that we consider unlikely. ![[Pasted image 20250601063824.png]]
- **まい used for a strong decision or determination not to do something**: So we can say `二度と行くまい` (I won't go there again; literally, I won't go a second time). That's the other common meaning.
- **Attaching し to the まい construction**: And **this gives a construction that's somewhat comparable to the `it isn't as if...` or `it isn't like...` construction in English.** So if we say `金持ちでは**あるまいし**` which is roughly equivalent to the saying **in English** `it's **not as if** we're rich`, or `世界が終わるわけが**あるまいし**` (it's **not as if** the world is going to end).
### **`あるまい` is directly equivalent to `ないだろう`**
in other words, *A isn't B, I would conjecture, it seems likely etc.*

And **the interesting point here is that**, as we see, **with this conjectural use of the volitional **in its positive, more usual form**, we don't attach the volitional directly to the verb that we're conjecturing about.**

So **we don't say `さくらはすぐに帰ろう`.** **That doesn't mean `Sakura will probably come`.** **We say** `さくらはすぐに**来るでしょう** (or だろう)` (Cái này là chỉ về phỏng đoán, không phải là "ý chí"). `そんなことは**あるまい**` is directly equivalent to `そんなことは**ないでしょう**`.

So, **the most common use of `まい` is as the negative adjectival of these `でしょう / だろう` conjectural constructions.**
