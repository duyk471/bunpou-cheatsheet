### ようになる
So when we have a logical clause plus `ようになる`, we're saying that something became or entered the state of being or the form of that logical clause (`よう` là danh từ). Ví dụ như: `彼を信じるようになった` nghĩa là `I came to believe him.` `彼を信じる` (or `zeroが彼を信じる`) --`I believe him` -- is a logical clause, and we're saying that I moved into the state, I became the state of that logical clause

Giải thích: `よう` là danh từ; the logical clause becomes the adjectival, the descriptor, for that noun, so we know that any verb-engine together with the logical clause it heads can become an adjectival so we're not saying `のよう`, we're NOT saying the likeness of something else here

### ようにする
`ようにする` is to make something enter a state. It doesn't enter it by itself; somebody's making it enter the state. So if we say `よく見えるにする` -- `よく見える` means to `look good`, so `よく見えるようにする` is to make someone or something look good.

(`Please make it so that you lock the door (this is important, so please make it be that way)` hay "Please turn the circumstance from one in which you don't lock the door into one in which you do lock the door."). If you choose `ようにする` over `ことにする` you're inherently leaving a little room for doubt.

Một cách dùng khác là: Now, related to this is when you may say something about yourself, usually related to something you do regularly, such as saying `毎日歩くようにする`. And that means literally, `[I] (try to) make it so that [I] walk every day`

"Để mà" - không phải là một cấu trúc ngữ pháp mới: `よく見えるように口紅をつける` -- "in order that she will look better (or I will look better, or someone will look better), apply lipstick" (`口紅をつける` is simply replacing the `する`)
