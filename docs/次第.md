### What is 次第？
**This first one, which is the kanji we use in `次` (THỨ - Tiếp theo), and that's what it means, `next`. And this one, `第` (Đệ - thứ tự), which is the Japanese ordinal**. Now, what's an ordinal? In Japanese, fortunately, we only have one ordinal for every number and it's `第`, and we put it before the number, not afterwards.

So what it means is **next thing in sequence / next thing in order** (〜したらすぐに / 〜が終わったらすぐに). And one more thing we need to know about this word is that it generally works by attaching to another noun. And this gives us a kind of compound.

### 次第 as `as soon as` or `immediately upon`
分かり**次第**お電話します
What you see that we have here the い-stem of 分かる (do understandable), which is 分かり, and we're creating a compound noun, which means  (Điều tiếp theo sau khi nó trở nên có thể hiểu được (分かり次第) là tôi sẽ gọi bạn (お電話します))

Từ hình trên: So, "**the next thing in sequence after the preparation's been completed is eat** / **As soon as the preparations for the meal are finished, we'll eat**".
### 次第 as `depending upon`
`それは**天気次第**だ` (Dịch là: Phụ thuộc vào thời tiết).

In Japanese what we're saying is `that **follows directly from the weather**`. And, **as you see, it's a different way of putting it,** **but it means fundamentally the same thing.** Một ví dụ khác là: `彼の答えは**気分次第**だ.` Now, that means `his answer **follows directly from his mood**`. In other words, his answer **depends on what mood he's in**.

> **`手あたり次第` means `whatever one can lay one's hands on / whatever comes to hand`.** So, `**手あたり次第本**を読む` (I read **whatever book comes to hand**). Reading **a book follows directly from hand-touch of a book**, literally.

**Attaching 次第 to a person:** So if we say `**あなた次第**です`, we're essentially saying `it's **up to you** / it **follows directly from you**`.

**Tóm lại là:**
Within the Japanese meaning spectrum, **what `あなた次第だ` means is `it follows directly from you`:** **It's up to you, it's not up to anyone else, it doesn't follow from me,** **it doesn't follow from anybody else, it follows directly from you, it's up to you.**

### 次第 as `according to`
**From here we get meanings like `according to`:** `値段は**品次第**で違う`, which literally means `the price differs **directly following the goods**`. Một ví dụ khác: **If we use an expression like** `身分**次第**に暮らす`, we're saying `live **according to** one's station in life, **according to** one's means`.

### 次第 as a process, a set of circumstances, a course of events 
**Now, in some cases,** and this is where it becomes a little more extended, **`しだい` (next in sequence) can represent the whole sequence.** **So in these cases it can mean things like a process,** **a set of circumstances, a course of events.** So one might say, `それはこんな**次第**だった` (it was this **kind of situation**, it was this **kind of a sequence of events**).

### Cái cấu trúc ngữ pháp
!!! **This is simply the standard practice of taking a noun (`次第` is a noun)** **and using it adverbially to describe a verb.** (Về cơ bản chỉ là thêm に vào để sử dụng như trạng từ?)
**And doing something `次第に`, in a `次第` manner,** **is as a sequence of steps or gradually.** So, `チェシャ猫は**次第に**消えた` (The Cheshire Cat disappeared **gradually**).

The real issue here, which doesn't tend to get explained, is that **when `次第` is not modified by another noun** **and it's on its own acting as an independent adverb,** **that's when it has this meaning.** So, in the example we saw earlier, `身分**次第に**暮らす`, **that isn't an example of this. It is being used adverbially,** **but what's modifying `暮らす` is not `次第` on its own but the compound `身分次第`.**
