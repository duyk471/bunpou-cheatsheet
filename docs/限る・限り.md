"限る" is a verb meaning "limit" or "restrict" còn "限り" là dạng い-stem = danh từ.
"限り", on the other hand, concentrates on the boundaries of that enclosure, the edges beyond which the enclosure does not reach.
### 限る

#### “出席は招待者に限る”
"出席" chỉ giới hạn trong "招待者" (invited persons). Ngoài cái giới hạn đó, "出席" không tồn tại (Chỉ giới hạn cho những người được mời)

Hoặc cách dùng theo nghĩa đen “声の限りに呼んだ” (I called at the limit of my voice).
#### “夏はアイスクリイムに限る” 
“Speaking of summer, when it comes to summer, it reaches its limit at ice cream”, in other words, ice cream
is the furthest you can take summer

Một ví dụ mang màu nghĩa tương tự cái này là: “運動なら水泳に限る” = (if it’s exercise / if we’re talking about exercise, it reaches its limit with swimming [“水泳”] / swimming is absolutely the best kind of exercise).

And moving on from this we get expressions like “彼女に限ってそんなことはしない” -> “She is the very limit of people who wouldn’t do such a thing”. 
### 限る used negatively (not limited to x)
Now, the concept of "限る" (limit) is often used negatively to show that something is not limited to a
particular statement, a particular notion.

“辞書に書いてあることが常に正しいとは限らない”. And this "-とは限らない" essentially sums up the previous statement and says that’s not limited to being the case.
### 限り
- “私の知っている限りではそんな言葉はない” (the limit of what I know): “Up to the limit of what I know, there is no such word.”
- `その場限りことを言う` means she says things **on the spur of the moment**

`喧嘩はその場限りさ`: But the point here is that quarrels should be limited to "その場" (the occasion, the event on which they arise). So if you quarrel with someone today you shouldn't be carrying on that quarrel tomorrow.
Very good advice.
